# IRC 💻💬

This project is an implementation of an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client and server.

## Run

Do ```make``` and then run:

```bash
./ircserv <port> <password>
```

You can also run the program without arguments and it will take them from the configuration file.

```bash
./ircserv
```

## Connect 📶

First, we will install a client application. In this case, we have chosen irssi to do the project.

```sudo apt instal irssi```

If you do not have sudo permissions you must install brew and install the client.

```brew install irssi```

Once we have the server running and have the client installed we must run it.

```irssi```

To connect to the server we must type the following:

```bash
/connect <IP> <port> <password> 
```
